    "title": "Disease X: Scientists identify prevention strategy; urge preparedness - The Times of India",
    "mainText": "A new strategy for disease X prevention\n\nThere is a big fear called Disease X, in the global health field. It is an unknown pathogen that could cause a serious global outbreak. As the globe struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and faces the prospect of more outbreaks, scientists are investigating novel approaches to illness prevention. One of these strategies is a paradigm change in how we view bats, who have long been demonised as disease carriers. Here we will learn more about Disease X and consider how peaceful coexistence with bats may revolutionise efforts to prevent pandemics.\n\nWhat is disease X?\n\nDisease X, as designated by the World Health Organization (WHO), represents a hypothetical pathogen with the potential to cause a global health crisis. While the current priority diseases include familiar ones like COVID-19 and Ebola, Disease X symbolises the threat of an unknown adversary. With the majority of emerging infectious diseases originating from animals, vigilance and surveillance are crucial in identifying and monitoring potential sources of Pathogen X.\n\nThe role of bats in disease transmission\n\nContrary to popular belief, bats are not the enemy in the fight against pandemics; they are, in fact, essential players in ecosystem balance. However, disturbances to bat habitats and activities such as hunting and consumption increase the risk of zoonotic spillover events, where pathogens leap from animals to humans. Recognising bats as reservoirs for various viruses, including those closely related to Disease X, underlines the urgency of preserving their habitats and minimising human-bat interactions.\n\nPreserving bat habitats\n\nPeacefully coexisting with bats is a novel strategy proposed by researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society and Cornell University to prevent future pandemics. Their research, which was published in 'The Lancet Planetary Health,' refutes the widespread belief that bats are disease carriers and suggests that humans avoid upsetting them. Researchers advocate for a shift towards preserving bat habitats as a proactive measure in pandemic prevention. By minimising human interference in areas such as cave tourism and deforestation, we can reduce the likelihood of zoonotic transmission and safeguard public health. This approach not only protects biodiversity but also acknowledges the invaluable ecosystem services provided by bats, from insect control to pollination.\n\nAddressing the root causes of pandemics necessitates systemic changes, including curbing the commercial wildlife trade and revisiting consumption habits. Mixing different animal species in markets creates fertile ground for pathogen transmission, as witnessed in previous outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2. Urgent behavioural shifts are required to mitigate these risks, with a focus on respecting wildlife and their ecological roles.\n\nWhat should be the new approach?\n\nIn the face of mounting challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases, embracing a new approach to pandemic prevention is imperative. By establishing a taboo against disturbing bats and supporting conservation efforts, we can take proactive steps towards averting future pandemics at their source. While the path ahead may be uncertain, the benefits of preserving biodiversity and protecting public health make it a journey worth undertaking.",

    "title": "Start your day right! 5 foods to eat on an empty stomach - The Indian Express",
    "mainText": "The way you begin your day sets the tone for the hours ahead, and choosing the right foods to kickstart your morning can have a significant impact on your overall health and well-being. Eating the right foods on an empty stomach can jumpstart your metabolism, provide essential nutrients, and boost your energy levels. Nutritionist Sakshi Lalwani took to Instagram to share five foods you can eat on an empty stomach to improve your health.\n\nJayfal or Nutmeg Powder\nNisha Mandal, consultant dietician, and nutritionist at Motherhood Hospitals, Gurgaon, tells indianexpress.com that consuming nutmeg powder on an empty stomach has several benefits.\n\n“It is believed to aid digestion by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes and promoting gastric motility, which can help alleviate symptoms of indigestion and bloating. Nutmeg is rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, which may help boost immunity and reduce inflammation in the body when taken before meals,” she said.\n\nMandal noted that nutmeg should not be consumed empty stomach during pregnancy. However, being rich in dietary fibre, it can alleviate pregnancy-related discomfort.\n\nShe cautions that an overdose of nutmeg can lead to an upset gut and even intoxication. “A safe dosage would be 1 mg per day.”\n\nAnjeer or Fig\nAccording to Mandal, figs are high in fibre and contain vitamins and minerals such as potassium and calcium. “Consuming figs before breakfast may promote satiety and help control appetite throughout the day, making them a nutritious addition to your morning routine.”\n\nAdditionally, figs are advised to pregnant women as they are rich in iron, folate, and fibre, which support fetal development and prevent neural tube defects. “On an empty stomach, figs aid in better bowel movements and higher energy levels,” Mandal said.\n\nMethi Dana (Fenugreek Seeds) and Ginger\nWhile fenugreek seeds are known for their ability to regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity, ginger has anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe digestive discomfort.\n\n“Together, methi dana and ginger can aid digestion, reduce bloating, and promote overall gut health when consumed on an empty stomach,” Mandal advised. However, pregnant women should steer clear of it on an empty stomach.\n\nHaleem Seeds (Garden Cress Seeds)\nHaleem seeds are packed with nutrients, including iron, calcium, and vitamins C and E, which are essential for maintaining healthy blood and bones. Additionally, haleem seeds are believed to have medicinal properties that can help improve respiratory health and boost immunity.\n\nMandal recommends consuming them before breakfast as it can enhance nutrient absorption and promote overall well-being. “Consuming it with vitamin C-rich fruits can aid digestion and increase absorption of iron from haleem seeds. One teaspoon of haleem seeds daily fulfills 60 per cent of the iron requirement, making it beneficial during pregnancy.”\n\nHorse Gram Powder\nStarting your day with horse gram powder can help regulate blood sugar levels, improve digestion, and promote weight loss due to its high fibre and low glycemic index. Horse gram also has a variety of medicinal and culinary benefits due to its protein and fibre-rich content.",

    "title": "The Mystery of Zombie Deer Disease: Alarming Truth Behind Chronic Wasting Disease Revealed! - BioTecNika",
    "mainText": "Understanding Zombie Deer Disease: A Growing Concern in America\n\nIn the serene landscapes of North America’s forests and plains, a troubling trend called chronic wasting disease (CWD) is silently spreading among deer populations. This neurological condition, often referred to as “zombie deer disease,” is causing alarm among scientists, conservationists, and the general public due to its increasing prevalence.\n\nThe Mysterious Culprit: Prions At the core of the CWD issue lies a strange culprit known as prions. These misfolded proteins have the ability to cause normal proteins in the brain to misfold as well, resulting in neurological degeneration. What makes prion diseases especially worrisome is their resilience and ability to persist in the environment for extended periods, resisting conventional disinfection methods.\n\nHealth and Environmental Risks The spread of CWD not only poses ecological risks but also potential health risks for humans. While there is no definitive evidence of direct transmission to humans, prion diseases have been known to cross the species barrier with serious consequences. For instance, the outbreak of “mad cow disease” in Britain led to significant cattle slaughter and human deaths. While confirmed cases of CWD in humans are lacking, concerns remain due to the potential for transmission through hunting and consumption of infected animals.\n\nChallenges in Detection and Diagnosis Detecting and diagnosing prion diseases in humans is inherently challenging due to the lack of immune response triggered by prions. This complicates early intervention efforts and highlights the need for improved detection methods to contain the spread of CWD.\n\nLong-Term Implications on Human Health The persistence of prions in the environment means that humans could be indirectly exposed through contaminated soil, water, and other environmental sources. The long-term implications of CWD on human health remain uncertain but necessitate serious consideration due to the resilience of prions.\n\nEcological and Economic Impact Beyond health concerns, the proliferation of CWD poses significant risks to both ecosystems and economies. Deer hunting, a popular recreational activity and livelihood source, could be threatened by CWD, potentially disrupting food security in affected regions. Moreover, the decline in deer populations could have cascading effects on vegetation dynamics and other wildlife species dependent on deer.\n\nInternational Considerations Although CWD outbreaks have not occurred in the UK, cases in Europe highlight the need for international cooperation in monitoring and controlling the disease. This emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to address the challenges posed by CWD.\n\nMitigating Risks and Protecting Wildlife To combat the threats posed by CWD, enhanced surveillance and monitoring, stringent biosecurity measures, and increased research efforts are essential.",

    "mainText": "While eating protein is essential for good health, US researchers have discovered a molecular mechanism by which excessive dietary protein could increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the build-up of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in and on the artery walls. The study, which combined small human trials with experiments in mice and cells in a Petri dish, showed that consuming over 22 per cent of dietary calories from protein can lead to increased activation of immune cells that play a role in atherosclerotic plaque formation, driving the disease risk. Furthermore, the scientists showed that one amino acid—leucine—seems to have a disproportionate role in driving the pathological pathways linked to atherosclerosis, or stiff, hardened arteries.\n\nBabak Razani, Professor of cardiology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, emphasizes that dialing up protein intake in pursuit of better metabolic health is not a panacea. It could potentially cause real damage to your arteries. The hope is that this research starts a conversation about ways of modifying diets in a precise manner that can influence body function at a molecular level and dampen disease risks.\n\nPrevious studies have also shown that overreliance on protein may not be such a good thing for long-term health. Following their 2020 research, in which Razani’s laboratory first showed that excess dietary protein increases atherosclerosis risk in mice, his next study in collaboration with Bettina Mittendorfer, a metabolism expert at the University of Missouri, Columbia, delved deeper into the potential mechanism and its relevance to the human body. They demonstrated that amino acids, the building blocks of protein, can trigger disease through specific signaling mechanisms and alter the metabolism of cells. For instance, small immune cells in the vasculature called macrophages can trigger the development of atherosclerosis. Consuming more than 22 per cent of daily dietary calories through protein can negatively affect macrophages responsible for clearing out cellular debris, leading to the accumulation of a \"graveyard\" of those cells inside the vessel walls and worsening of atherosclerotic plaques over time. Interestingly, the analysis of circulating amino acids showed that leucine—an amino acid enriched in animal-derived foods like beef, eggs, and milk—is primarily responsible for abnormal macrophage activation and atherosclerosis risk, suggesting a potential avenue for further research on personalized diet modification, or \"precision nutrition\".\n\nThe findings are published in the journal Nature Metabolism. It’s crucial to consider these insights as we strive to balance our protein intake for overall health and well-being.",

    "mainText": "Metabolism is an important aspect of weight loss. Adding these few foods in diet post meals can help boost metabolic rate helping to drop weight faster. These foods are:\n\n1. Green Tea: Rich in antioxidants, green tea can enhance metabolism and promote fat oxidation. Drinking a cup of green tea after meals may aid in weight management.\n2. Chili Peppers: Capsaicin, the compound responsible for the spiciness in chili peppers, can temporarily increase metabolic rate. Add some spicy peppers to your meal for a metabolism boost.\n3. Protein-Rich Foods: Including protein in your post-meal diet can increase the thermic effect of food (TEF), which means your body burns more calories during digestion. Opt for lean protein sources like chicken, fish, tofu, or legumes.\n4. Whole Grains: Whole grains provide complex carbohydrates and fiber, which help regulate blood sugar levels and prevent insulin spikes. This stability in blood sugar can positively impact metabolism.\n5. Water: Staying hydrated is essential for efficient metabolism. Drinking water after meals aids digestion and supports metabolic processes.\n\nRemember that while these foods can contribute to a healthier metabolism, overall dietary habits and physical activity play crucial roles in weight loss.

    "mainText": "Bengaluru sees a rise in upper tract respiratory illnesses from mid-November to mid-February every year. However, some doctors told Metrolife the incidence was unusually higher this season. In many cases, cough and cold persisted for over a month, they said. The normal span is five to seven days. They attribute this to the chilly weather, weather change, dust, pollution, increased travelling, overcrowding during marriages, and even Covid. “The pollen season will last until early April. People with allergies need to be cautious,” says pulmonologist Dr Sachin Kumar. Experts share some preventive measures:\n\n1. Focus on personal habits: Don’t touch dirty surfaces (such as used handkerchiefs) and then touch your mouth, eyes, or face. Washing your hands regularly, eating a balanced diet, getting physical activity, and clocking restful sleep are other suggestions.\n2. Mask appropriately: Precautions advised during the Covid-19 pandemic still hold good. So, wear a mask in public or crowded places, sanitize your hands, follow coughing etiquette, and work from home when sick.\n3. Check on vaccination: Adults often overlook vaccination. The flu shot is important for everyone, especially those with comorbidities like diabetes, immuno-compromised individuals, and those above the age of 65. It can lower the risk of viral infections. The two-shot pneumococcal vaccine can also protect against bacterial infections. Always consult your doctor before taking any shots.\n4. Misconceptions: Drinking hot water regularly does not scientifically keep throat infections at bay. Staying hydrated is essential, whether with hot or normal water. However, daily steam inhalation may damage the surface lining of the windpipe and throat.\n\nRemember to take these insights into account as you strive to maintain good respiratory health1.",
