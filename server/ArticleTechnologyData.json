        "title": "Publisher Midnight Works Allegedly Targeting YouTuber For Calling Out Its \"Scam\" Switch Games - Nintendo Life",
        "mainText": "Luke Wild, a YouTuber who runs the channel SwitchStars, is known for his focus on identifying and highlighting games on the Switch eShop that are of low effort and poor quality. He recently released a video in which he alleges that his channel has been targeted by the publisher Midnight Works. This Moldovan company has been responsible for many of the games that Wild has critiqued over the years. In his video, Wild presents messages he received via Discord that alerted him to a request allegedly made by Midnight Works to its staff to submit false reports to YouTube. These direct messages, purportedly from employees of Midnight Works who were blowing the whistle on the company's actions, warned Wild of an impending attempt to disrupt his channel. The message, when translated by machine, seems to be a request sent through the company's Slack channel, asking employees to select randomly and submit harassment reports on 5-10 of Wild's videos, with instructions to submit one strike from their home computer and one from their phone. Wild infers from the increased activity on his channel shortly after this message was allegedly sent that it is likely genuine. He received another screenshot the following day that appeared to show the same request, but this time it included a timestamp and showed the company's Human Resources manager as the sender, with the recipients being 239 members of a 'team-midnight' Slack group. According to the Midnight Works' website, their team comprises over 240 individuals. Unlike copyright claims, which Midnight Works has previously filed against SwitchStars without success, Wild states that harassment reports are anonymous and he does not receive notifications when they are submitted. We have reached out to Midnight Works for comment and will update this article with any response.",

        "mainText": "Samsung is set to debut its first smart ring, likely to be christened the Galaxy Ring, at the forthcoming Mobile World Congress 2024 in Barcelona. The technology behemoth is looking to broaden its health-centric wearables portfolio and offered a preview of the ring at the Galaxy S24 launch event last month. While specific details are yet to be revealed, Samsung's recent statement promises users that the Galaxy Ring will provide enhanced personalized experiences through advancements in artificial intelligence. The smart ring is anticipated to supplement Samsung's existing Galaxy Watch series, offering additional health-tracking capabilities. The ring's compact form factor paves the way for comprehensive health monitoring, including measuring blood flow for heart rate, tracking respiration, and potentially incorporating ECG functionality to detect irregular heart rhythms, similar to recent models from Apple and Samsung's Galaxy Watch. One of the most eagerly awaited features of the Galaxy Ring is its rumored ability to continuously monitor glucose levels, representing a significant breakthrough for individuals with diabetes. If realized, Samsung could potentially outpace competitors, including Apple, in bringing a non-invasive glucose monitoring solution to market, marking a critical advancement in health technology. Beyond health tracking, leaks suggest that the Galaxy Ring may feature device control and contactless payment capabilities, enabling users to manage devices and make payments without the need for a phone or wallet. Samsung's unified software ecosystem positions the company favorably in the smart ring segment. While the official launch is slated for later in 2024, the unveiling at Mobile World Congress 2024 is expected to provide the first insights into the Galaxy Ring's capabilities and functionalities.",

The report suggests that the internal development timeline for the successor to the Switch was adjusted to circumvent issues related to component shortages. Although Nintendo had initially planned a late 2024 launch for the 'Switch 2', Nikkei indicates that 'priority was given to ensure the initial inventory of the successor console and a lineup of software titles at the time of its launch' in an effort to prevent widespread reselling. Nikkei anticipates that the next Nintendo console will once again be a hybrid portable-home device, similar to the Switch, as previously reported by VGC. The publication also corroborates that the machine will have a larger screen than the original Switch's 6.2 inch display. Nikkei notes that the Switch 2 could yet slip beyond March 2025, dependent on manufacturing and how much software is ready for launch.",

This marks Samsung's initial venture into the burgeoning smart ring market. The Galaxy Ring is designed to supplement Samsung's existing wearables, such as the Galaxy Watch series. Samsung has managed to incorporate all its innovations into the smallest wearable form that one can wear around the clock. The Galaxy Ring will be available in three colors ï¿½ platinum silver, ceramic black, and gold. Despite its chunky profile, similar to other smart rings, Samsung assures that it feels lightweight. It will be available in sizes ranging from 5 to 13, marked S to XL inside the band. The ring houses a small battery that varies from 14.5mAh in the smallest size to 21.5mAh in the largest. The Galaxy Ring is designed to monitor a variety of health metrics through its built-in sensor array. It will provide readings on heart rate, respiratory rate, the amount of movement made during sleep, and the time it takes a person to fall asleep once in bed. The ring will also offer cycle and fertility tracking through an integration with the existing Samsung partner app, Natural Cycles. The ring will provide a 'vitality score' designed to 'collect data about physical and mental readiness to see how productive you can be.' This metric will measure sleep, activity, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability to determine the user's energy levels and readiness for the day. Users will receive personalized health tips and recommendations through new 'Booster Cards' in the Samsung Health app. These will leverage data from the ring and Samsung's AI to offer scientifically validated guidance. Samsung also revealed it is developing an AI-powered digital health coach. The envisioned 'coach' would provide personalized health guidance and motivation informed by the full suite of the user's Samsung health data.",

The device is notable for its 6,000mAh battery and 70W charging capability. It comes bundled with several accessories, including 3.5mm earbuds, a charger, a USB cable, and a case. The Pova 6 Pro has a striking design, with color-matched rubber lines around the frame and the camera island cutout, a detail that adds a nice touch to Tecno's design. Being a Pova device, it features LED lights on the back - a circular light around one of the camera lenses, and a long Y-shaped light next to it. This Dynamic-Light Effect can be customized in different styles and can flash for calls, notifications, during music playback, gaming, charging, or stay on all the time. The device sports a 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 120 Hz refresh rate. The back has an interesting pattern design that catches light and reflects it in different shapes. However, the glossy finish is highly prone to fingerprints and dust. The Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 6080 chipset and 12 GB of RAM. It runs Tecno's functional HiOS on top of the latest Android 14. The device only uses its main camera - a 108MP imager that also serves as a 3x unit.",

These features include using Gemini to craft messages, AI-generated captions for images, summarizing texts through AI for Android Auto, and access to passes on Wear OS. Despite facing criticism for its Gemini implementation for image generation, Google is not deterred from rolling it out in a different context. Starting this week, Google Messages will get a feature that lets you access Gemini in the app. This feature is currently in beta and only supports English. Google is also rolling out a feature for Android Auto that reads out summaries of long text messages and contextualizes group chats. The feature, first announced last month, also dishes out quick suggestions for replies. Google is launching a few accessibility-related features at MWC as well. The companyï¿½s Lookout app, which helps visually impaired people with things like food labels and documents, will now generate AI-powered captions for images that have missing or inaccurate captions or alt text. The feature is now rolling out to all users across the globe with support for English. Last year, Google updated the Lookout app with an AI-powered assistant, which allowed users to ask questions about images. Google is also rolling out improved screen reader support for Lens in Maps. Users can point their phoneï¿½s camera around them and TalkBack will read information about places and signs. On the productivity front, Google is extending support for handwritten notes to docs on Android phones or tablets using just a finger or a stylus. You can choose from different pen styles and colors to highlight certain points in a document. Additionally, the company is launching support for Spotify through an output switcher on the Android home screen. This means you can resume listening to a song or a podcast from one source to another source with Spotify. Previously this feature only supported YouTube Music. Google is also updating the Fitbit app with support to get data from different sources like AllTrails, Oura Ring, and MyFitnessPal.",

        "mainText": "Samsung has finally unveiled the Galaxy Ring at the Mobile World Conference (MWC 2024), following its teaser from the previous day. The Galaxy Ring is a health and wellness-focused device designed to streamline daily activities. The device will be available in three colors: platinum silver, gold, and ceramic black. It is expected to go on sale later this year. Samsung did not reveal much about the Galaxy Ring when it first displayed a render of the device at Unpacked last month. All that was known at the time was that it would be a wellness-oriented wearable positioned to rival Oura and that it would have a suite of unknown sensors. Journalists were not allowed to photograph it today, but some additional images from Samsung show it to be a chunky, concave ring about the same size as the Oura, according to a supplied image. The extra girth isn't surprising, given the electronics cached inside. Still, The Verge noted that it was lighter than expected and will be offered in sizes 5 to 13, marked S through XL inside the band. The size of the battery (and thus time between charges) will vary depending on the size, ranging from 14.5mAh to 21.5mAh. Battery life is unknown, but the Oura can go up to seven days between charges. According to a blog from Samsung VP Dr. Hon Pak, the ring will track sleep based on heart rate, movement, and breathing, then provide users advice based on that. The company will also glean data from partner Natural Cycles, which already does fertility tracking on the Galaxy Watch, matching a key Oura feature. The Galaxy Ring will also offer a new tool called My Vitality Score that measures alertness so users can see if they're at their best. Feedback will be available via 'Booster Cards' that offer science-based tips using sleep and other data gathered by the device. The Galaxy Ring will be part of the Samsung Health ecosystem and be compatible with the Galaxy Watch. That means you'll be able to use both devices at once to track your health and get higher quality data as a result. That said, the advantage of a ring wearable is that it's far less annoying to sleep with it. We'll learn more in the months ahead, including the exact sensor suite, pricing, and sale date.",

        "mainText": "Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently voiced his dissatisfaction with a newly purchased Windows PC laptop on social media. Musk criticized the device for its requirement to create a Microsoft account for basic functionality, which he believes infringes on user privacy and control. He specifically raised concerns about granting access to Microsoft's artificial intelligence (AI) on his computer, calling it 'messed up.' 'Just bought a new PC laptop and it wonï¿½t let me use it unless I create a Microsoft account, which also means giving their AI access to my computer! This is messed up,' Musk said in a post on X. 'There used to be an option to skip signing into or creating a Microsoft account,' he further said. Musk's comments sparked discussions on social media, with some users echoing his concerns about data privacy and potential AI influence. However, others pointed out that creating a Microsoft account is a standard practice for Windows PCs, offering features like cloud storage, app downloads, and system updates. Muskï¿½s post got many people offering him alternate solutions. Interestingly, one was by Xï¿½s ï¿½fact-checkï¿½ feature Community Notes. 'It is still possible to set-up the latest version of Windows without a Microsoft account,' Community Notes suggest. Musk countered with pointing out that the fact checking tool was indeed wrong. 'Community Notes is failing here. This option no longer exists,' Musk said. Another user suggested that Musk should get in touch with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. To which Musk said that he had texted Nadella about the issue. Microsoft has yet to officially respond to Musk's comments.

        "mainText": "WhatsApp has recently introduced support for higher quality animated stickers. This is a significant update for users who frequently use this feature. Previously, animated stickers on WhatsApp were limited to the WebP format. While this format is efficient in terms of storage, it does not offer the best quality, especially when viewed on larger screens. The new update introduces support for the Lottie file format for animated stickers. Unlike WebP, which is a raster file format, Lottie is a vector file format. This means that stickers in the Lottie format will maintain their quality regardless of the size at which they are viewed. As a result, these stickers will look sharp on both small and large screens. In addition to offering better quality, stickers in the Lottie format can also provide more fluid motions, vibrant colors, and intricate details compared to those in the WebP format. Despite these improvements, the file size of stickers in the Lottie format is expected to be similar to or smaller than those in the WebP format. Therefore, users can enjoy higher quality animated stickers without worrying about them taking up more storage space.",

        "mainText": "Qualcomm has unveiled the FastConnect 7900 at the Mobile World Congress 2024. The FastConnect 7900 is a new connectivity system that integrates Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and Ultra Wideband (UWB). Itï¿½s built on a 6nm process node compared to 14nm for the 7800, with 40% lower power usage. Having UWB, Wi-Fi Ranging, and Bluetooth Channel Sounding in one chip is said to 'create a powerful suite of proximity technologies that enable security rich device discovery, access, and control' for digital (car) keys, object finding, and indoor navigation use cases. Meanwhile, AI is used to optimize power consumption, network latency, and throughput. The FastConnect 7900 will launch commercially in the second half of 2024. Alongside the FastConnect 7900, Qualcomm also announced the Snapdragon X80 5G modem. It supports 6x carrier aggregation for sub-6GHz bands with peak 5G download speeds of 10 Gbps and 3.5 Gbps upload. Thereï¿½s also 'fully integrated' NB-NTN satellite communications support. The Snapdragon X80 supports 3GPP Release 17 and Release 18, while Qualcomm touts software updatability to support 5G Advanced when that becomes available. It once again features an AI processor (tensor accelerator) to 'improve data speeds, latency, quality of service (QoS), coverage, location accuracy, spectrum efficiency, power efficiency and multi-antenna management.' The first devices with Snapdragon X80 will also launch in the second half of 2024].",

        "mainText": "Microsoft is currently testing a new feature that will allow Windows Update to apply new operating system updates without requiring a system reboot. This change is intended to improve the user experience by reducing the interruptions caused by mandatory restarts. The feature, known as 'hot patching,' is designed to apply updates to the system while it is still running, eliminating the need for a reboot. Hot patching works by establishing a baseline with the current Cumulative Update for Windows Server. Periodically (starting every three months), the baseline is refreshed with the latest Cumulative Update, then hot patches are released for two months following. This means the need to reboot should be reduced to four times a year. However, there is a catch. According to the latest documentation for Windows Insider builds, users have to have Virtualization Based Security (VBS) enabled in order to avoid a restart. This setting has been known to negatively impact gaming performance. So, that might be enough to end the hope of reboot-less Windows updates for gamers right there. Microsoft is reportedly aiming to include the feature with the release of the Windows 24H2 update later this year.",
